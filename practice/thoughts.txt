 The first song you write will be bad. But the next song that you write will be bad. But the next song that you write will be bad.
 Make lots of bad songs.

 When I noticed I was making a lot of similar structures in my songs I made a template to help me quickly start up new projects. As soon as I finished it I hated it and vowed never to use it. Because struggle is life.

 Every 4 bars should introduce something new, or remove something old.

 When writing guitar it's easy to think in blocks of 4 chords, and to do intro-verse-bridge-chorus. When writing music on computer it's easy to get stuck in a loop of 2 chords over and over. Because none of the chunks you've written are in those chords and you don't want to do it again.


 Everything is a placeholder until it isn't.

 If everything is emphasized then nothing is.

 Wall of sound is good. Clutter is bad. Keep adding things and removing things until it feels right.

 Too clean vs too dirty.
 Too simple vs too complex.
 Too melodic vs too dischordant.
