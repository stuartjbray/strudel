 To run strudel locally with no online dependancies.

 1) clone this locally:
 https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel#readme

 2) install pnpm globally

 3) 
 pnpm i
 pnpm dev

 4) To serve samples locally go to strudel/samples and run npx @strudel/sampler

    PLAN
 Currently all tunes saved in bitbucket.
 Find the repo with all the default sounds in. Save that locally.

 Might work crudely - but many samples are multi-files - eg piano played at different pitches.

 samples({
  chirp: 'chirp.mp3'
  },'http://192.168.1.23:5432/')
// $: sound("chirp")
