 To run strudel locally with no online dependancies.

 1) clone this locally:
 https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel#readme

 2) install pnpm globally

 3) 
 pnpm i
 pnpm dev

 4) To serve samples locally go to strudel/samples and run npx @strudel/sampler

    PLAN
 Currently all tunes saved in bitbucket.
 Find the repo with all the default sounds in. Save that locally.

 Might work crudely - but many samples are multi-files - eg piano played at different pitches.

 samples({
  chirp: 'chirp.mp3'
  },'http://192.168.1.23:5432/')
// $: sound("chirp")


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 Copy all sounds locally.

  1) Get list of all the sounds you use.
  - Done via extract_sounds.html

  2) write a .str which plays each sound at a range of octaves.
  3) find the downloaded sounds which were created as a result.
  4) upload those to my own repo.
  5) repoint my tracks to use this repo instead.

   [] Test storing sounds on my repo:
    - Have left comment in discord: https://discord.com/channels/779427371270275082/779737254465765426
    - Found files in chrome DevTools > App > Cache Storage > external samples.
    - Can't find files here: C:\Users\Stuart Bray\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data

    Feedback says I can copy the files direct from github, put them in my own repo and reference them from there.
    Have downloaded 0.45 Gb and added to samples. But the VCSL is 4 Gb zipped.
    Putting them into bitbucket has limits - eg 3.5 per push, and 2Gb per repo - so DO NOT do this.
    
    [] I could stick into a public S3 from my account, then make links and point to them. --- TRY THIS!!!
