**"Please refactor this Strudel code to use the 'pass function' pattern. For each instrument type that has repeated sound/scale/color/effects settings, create a pass function at the top that applies those common settings. Then compress the code so that patterns are defined inline within the pass function calls, eliminating intermediate variables.
For example, if I have:
var drums1 = n(`
 x . 
 y .
`)
var _drums1 = drums1.sound("808").gain(.5).color("red")
It should become:
var drumsPass = (x) => x.sound("808").gain(.5).color("red")
var _drums1 = drumsPass(n(`
 x . 
 y .
`))
Please maintain the same functionality while making the code more concise and maintainable."**
